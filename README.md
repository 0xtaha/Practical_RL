# Practical_RL Fall 2017
A course on reinforcement learning in the wild.
Taught on-campus at [HSE](https://cs.hse.ru)(russian) and maintained to be friendly to online students (both english and russian).

#### Manifesto:
* __Optimize for the curious.__ For all the materials that aren’t covered in detail there are links to more information and related materials (D.Silver/Sutton/blogs/whatever). Assignments will have bonus sections if you want to dig deeper.
* __Practicality first.__ Everything essential to solving reinforcement learning problems is worth mentioning. We won't shun away from covering tricks and heuristics. For every major idea there should be a lab that allows to “feel” it on a practical problem.
* __Git-course.__ Know a way to make the course better? Noticed a typo in a formula? Found a useful link? Made the code more readable? Made a version for alternative framework? You're awesome! [Pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) it!
