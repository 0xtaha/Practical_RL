## Homework
Again, two options:

Unless you are already familiar with lasagne or you are super-good with tensorflow/pytorch/similar, we recommend you to pick the first option. If you have already done it, you can resubmit it and get points for free or pick the second option.

* [__recommended__] Either go to Seminar3.5-*-mnist.ipynb and follow the instructions (ends with lasagne MNIST classifier)
* [__alternative__] Or go to Seminar3.5-approx-q-learning.ipynb and follow the instructions (ends with simple NN for q-learning)
