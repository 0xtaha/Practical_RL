# Homeworks
This course uses Anytask — a platform for submitting homeworks. Below are the invite codes onto it.

* Anytask course is http://anytask.org/course/272
* **HSE** invite is `reHroOk`
* **YSDA** invite is TBA


First thing you need to do is to register there. Just follow the link to the course and enter the appropriate code.


# Default deadlines
Deadlines for each assignment are set in 10 days from the corresponding seminar, unless explicitly specified otherwise.
Assignments are added each week unless explicitly specified otherwise.


# Grading

The course grade depends entirely on points obtained mostly by completing homework assignments. __There will be no course exam at the end.__

Some assignment examples are “Implement value iteration algorithm for gridworld”, “Implement and optimize approximate crossentropy method with basic neural networks”, “Compare continuous RL approaches to bipedal robot walking problem”

__All assignments have descriptions in ./week*/README.md files like [this](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/blob/master/week0/README.md)__

Almost all assignments will have a jupyter notebook handout and a “your code for X goes here” style problems.
A fully and correctly implemented assignment yields 10 points (sometimes more, depending on the assignment). Doing something great on top of that yields bonus points.

## Lateness penalty
Assignments are subject deadlines and will yield less points if submitted past deadline.
In particular, submissions past deadline will be penalized by __-0.5__ point per day.

Homework can't yield negative amount of points, even if submitted 2 years past deadline.

__Homeworks that got imperfect grade can be re-submitted__

If you want to resubmit your home assignment, write about it in cirtain anytask week.

If you think that you have a special circumstances (like your grandmother's wedding) that prevented you from completing an assignment in time, ping course staff. We can cancel penalty for you.

## Frameworks
One can use any languages/frameworks beyond the recommended one at his own risk.
Srsly, if you’re not Andrej Karpathy or Volodymyr Mnih or something, at least consider the recommended way;
Yes, we know that <your_language/framework_name> is infinitely superior in all aspects. So what?

## Final grade

__Final grade__ is a sum of points, divided by 20 and rounded down. You cannot have a mark above 10. 


## Recommended trajectory

There will be several assignments and also an optional course project for ~40 points.

It's ultimately your decision, but there are a few "recommended" course trajectories you may want to consider.
