In this week you can find several sections covering advanced topics in RL, along with less advanced topics that we couldn't squeeze into the main track

## Advanced policy gradient methods
This section covers some steroids for policy gradient methods, along with a cool general trick called

## Reinforcement learning in large/continuous action spaces
While you already know algorithms that will work with continuously many actions, it can't hurt to learn something more specialized.
